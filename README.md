# Logic-Design-Project using proteus



Traffic lights (or traffic signals) are lights used to control the movement of traffic. They are placed
at road intersections and crossings. The different colors of lights tell drivers what to do.
Red light on: This tells drivers to stop.
Green light on: This means the driver can start driving or keep driving.
Yellow light on: This tells drivers to stop when it is safe to as the light is about to turn red.
We used some logic gates to design our 4-ways traffic light as required â€œor, And, Not. On the
other hand, we could used flip-flops to shorten &analyze the design.
